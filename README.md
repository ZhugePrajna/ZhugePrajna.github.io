An eccentric scholar, that's all.  
Language: **LoverRPG** | ***Ciallo~(∠·ω< )⌒★ C/ASM***

Game: Chess, Life.  
Activities: writing prose, recording curiosities, enjoying nature, learning.  
Amazing Major: focusing on CSS, with a side interest in celestial calculations.

Of course, I hope to research the Leisha-class hIE-Type-005 one day.  
[Maybe this era won’t be able to achieve that.]
