=====<Start>=====
Before everything begins,
you need to read this article:

"How To Ask Questions The Smart Way":
    http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
    https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way

Please don't mind me having you do this.
Everything happens for a reason.

If it weren't for some idiots,
I probably wouldn't be writing this article.
